        • Types of images:
        1. Raster: 
            - Made up of pixels.
            - So, larger the image, the more pixels we need resulting in larger file size.
            - Used for photos.
            - Come from camera or scanner.
            - Can be produced by software.
            - Formats: JPG or JPEG, PNG, GIF,WebP etc.
            - Look blurred if scaled up.
        2. Vector: 
            - Defined by a set of mathematical vectors like lines or curves.
            - Used for basic graphics, icons and logos.
            - Produced from the software (Illustrator).
            - Formats: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
            - So, these graphics are scalable and they look sharp at any size.
            
        - On the web we don't want to add large-sized images because they take time to download.

        • Formats:
        - WebP images are generally smaller in size but the problem with them is that they are not supported by Internet Explorer.
        - Transparency means the image having a transparent background so that it can be placed on any type of background.

        - If we need transparency, we use GIF or PNG.
        - If we want a lot of colors and details in our image we use PNG or WebP.
        - Use GIF, PNG, WebP for animations of few seconds long.
        - Most of the time, we use JPEG.

        • Two types of Images in HTML:
        1. Content Image
        2. Background Image

        • Content Image
        - Always provide description of image in alt attribute.
        - If in case, the image does not contain any useful description or it is used for decoration purpose only then leave alt attribute with a pair of double quote only.
        - If we do not add alt attribute then the screen reader will read the file name.
        - Most of the time image name is not descriptive so, we do not want the screen reader to read the file name.
        - That's why add alt attribute but do not provide any description.

        - By default, the image is displayed in its original size.
        - If we display a raster image in a size bigger than its original size then it becomes blurry.
        - This is because there are not enough
        pixels for the details.
        - This is not the problem with SVG images but we cannot produce a real image using lines and curves.
        - It will be too difficult.

        • Background Image
        - Used for decorative purposes.
        - To set a background image we can either use background-image property or background property.
