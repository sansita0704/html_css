        Problem:
        - The browser sends separate HTTP requests to the server.
        - If we have tons of images and millions of concurrent users, then all the users will send HTTP requests to the server.
        - This will cause a lot of overhead on the server.
        
        - To solve this we can use a technique called CSS sprites.
        - We will combine all these images into a single image and then we only have to send 1 HTTP request to the server to get the images.

        <!--
        - We should not always use CSS Sprites:
        1. File size can be too large.
        2. Sprites are not flexible because if we need to replace one image then we have to generate the sprite again.

        - So, we should use them for small-sized images like logos or icons.
