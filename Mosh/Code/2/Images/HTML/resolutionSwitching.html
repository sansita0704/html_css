        â€¢ Resolution Switching
        - When we want to provide different images for different devices like mobile phones, tablets, laptops.
        - Different images have different resolutions even if they have same DPR.

        - Now, if an image has to be displayed of a fixed size on all the devices then there is no problem.
        - But, if we use a relative unit like vw to set its width then it will have different size on different screens.
        - So, the browser has to resize the image for different screen size
        - Hence, it has to store the entire image in its memory which will be very costly for the browser.

        - So, we have to provide different versions of the image for different resolutions.
        - But its is not possible to provide image for all different resolutions.
        - So, what we do is, we provide a small, medium and large image and let the browser decide what image has to be used based on DPR and screen resolution.

        <img
            class="meal"
            src="../Images/meal.jpg"
            alt="A bowl of salmon and curry."
            srcset="
                ../Images/meal.jpg     400w,
                ../Images/meal@2x.jpg  800w,
                ../Images/meal@3x.jpg 1200w
            "
            sizes="
                (max-width: 500px) 100vw,
                (max-width: 700px) 50vw,
                33vw
            "
        />
        <!--
        - We use w to represent the actual width of the image.
        - So, here we do not care about the physical resolution of the screen.
        - We are just telling the size of the image to the browser.
        - So, we are saying that meal.jpg is 400 x 400px in size.

        - Now, browser know the size of the image so it can display any image according to DPR and resolution of the screen.

        - We can use sizes attribute with media conditions to specify the width of the image on the basis of screen size.
        - So, we have provided the size of different images and also specified the final size of the image based on screen size.
        - Using these info, the browser will determine itself that what image should be used.

        - It is not compulsory to provide three versions of the image and in 400, 800, 1200px width.
        - We can decide what version should we provide using https://www.responsivebreakpoints.com
