            type: 'number' has 2 benefits:
            1. On mobile phones, the keyboard that appears, it automatically changes to number keyboard.
            - So, it makes easier to use this form.
            2. Now, we can only set numbers to it.

            Attributes of input elements:

            • 'value': To pre-populate (pre-fill) the field.
                - Fill the field with some text before user enters some data.
            • 'placeholder': A label is visible in input field but as soon as we start writing, it disappears. 
            • readonly: User cannot write something.
                - So, we add value attribute with this attribute.
                - User is able to select the input field.
            • disabled: Just like readonly but the user can't select the field.
                - Also, the data written to value attribute is not sent to the server.
            • maxlength: Used for validation.
                - If it is set to 5, then the user can only write 5 characters not more than that.
            • autofocus: Boolean attribute i.e. we do not have to supply any value to it.
                - As soon as the page loads, that field gets automatically focused.

            - textarea also has same attributes as input element except value attribute.
            - To pre-populate them, we write the text in between its opening and closing tag.
            -->

            <textarea cols="60" rows="10"></textarea>
            <!--
            - To add more than 1 line input field, we use textarea.
            - cols: no. of characters in a line.
            - rows: no. of lines.
            - It is resizable in browser but if we want to stop it we can resize property.
            - While using milligram, if we change the rows and cols we don't see any change due to the height provided by the milligram.
            - But we can change its height.
            -->

            <input type="text" list="countries" autocomplete="off" />
            <datalist id="countries">
                <option value="1">Australia</option>
                <option data-value="2">Canada</option>
                <option>India</option>
                <option>United States</option>
            </datalist>
            <!--
            - To give a suggestion list to the user, we use datalist element and then use option element to give options to the user.
            - To associate the datalist with our input element, we give an id to datalist element and then use list attribute.
            - So, now the user can select something from the given options or he/she can even write something else i.e. not there is the list.
            - To force the user to enter the values from the given list only, we have to use dropdown.

            - Generally, the server has a huge database containing a list of countries where each country has a unique identifier associated with it.
            - So, while submitting the form, we want to send that unique identifier to the server.
            - So that on the server, we know which country that user has selected.
            - To do that, we use value attribute.
            - So, we set the value attribute with the unique id of the country.
            - But that id is visible to the user. We don't want that.

            - To do this, we use data attribute.
            - In HTML if we write 'data-' with an attribute, we can create a custom attribute.
            - Then later, using JS we can read the value of this attribute and can submit it to the server.

            - While using datalist, we want to turn off the autocomplete provided by the browser.
            - So that, if the user has previously typed something in the field then it doesn't shows that as a suggestion.

            - Every browser has a different look and feel of this suggestion list.
            - If we want it to look consistent across all the browsers, we can style it.
            - But if we write the styles in our style sheet then the browsers style will take over it.
            - Hence, the changes will not be visible.
            - We can use JS to solve this problem.
