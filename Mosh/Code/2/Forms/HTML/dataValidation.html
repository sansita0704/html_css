        - When submitting the forms, we need data validation.
        - For example,
        1. We need all the required fields to be filled.
        2. We need all email and date fields to have a valid email and date.
        3. We want fields like price aur age to not have a negative value.

        • required: boolean attribute to mark the field as a required field.
        - So, if the user submits the form without filling this field there will be an error.
        - We can change this error message using JS.
        • minlength: To limit the user to enter a min. no. of characters.
        • maxlength
        - We should always use maxlength otherwise the hacker can enter a really long string with thousands of characters and can wreck the website.

        - For email fields, we set type to email to validate the field.
        - For date fields, we set type to date to validate the field.

        - For numbers, use min and mix attribute to set the range of values.
        - We should always validate number field, especially when we don't want to allow negative values as negative values can easily cause data corruption.
