            - We can add a submit button using button as well as input element.
            - If we want an icon we have to use button element because between opening and closing tag we can write HTML code and add an icon.
            - But inside value attribute we can't write HTML code.
            - Also, using input field of type submit is conceptually wrong because input field are used to take input but submit button is not taking any input.
            - Now, to submit the form, each input field should have a name attribute.

            â€¢ Attributes for submitting the form
            1. action: It contains the URL where all the data will be sent.
            - Behind this URL, there is a server-side technology.
            e.g. - Node/Express: for JS developers
            - Django: for python developers

            2. method: means how we are sending the data.
            'POST': The value of the fields like name and email will be included in the body of the HTTP request sent to the backend (formspree.io)
            'GET': The fields are not included in the body of the request.
            - Instead, they are appended to the target URL.
            - So, when we submit the URL then the name and value pairs are added to the URL after question mark.
            - This is used when we want to bookmark the URL and use it whenever we want to.

            - Most of the times we use POST method.
