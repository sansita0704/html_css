        • System Font Stack:
        - Using this, we can tell the browser to use the default font of the OS of user's computer.
        - This boosts the performance because the browser doesn't have to download any font files.
        - So there will be no FOUT.
        - It will give our website more native or familier look as user will see the same font as he/she sees on his/her computer all the time.
        - So, overall it provides best user experience.

        - The only problem is that the default font of different OS is different.
        - So, the font will look different on different devices.
        
        • Difference between Web Safe Fonts and System Fonts:
        - Web Safe Fonts are the basic fonts which are available on almost every computer but they are very old and boring.
        - System Fonts are used by today's OS so they are more modern and look much better.

        • Adding System Fonts:
        For the value of font-family property: write '-apple' and press enter.

        • Sizing Fonts:
        - We should never use pixels for setting the font-size for our webpage.
        - This is because the pixels are not consistent across different devices.
        - e.g: Apple devices allow pixels to be smaller so that more pixels can fit on screen. That's why everything looks so sharp on them.
        - This is called Retina Display Technology.
