        - Font files comes in different formats just like image and video files.
        - Font formats:
            • TTF
            • OTF
            • EOT
            • WOFF
            • WOFF 2.0
        - For web, we use WOFF and WOFF 2.0 because they are compressed and more efficient for web.
        - TTF files are very big so we convert them to WOFF to use it for web.

        • Embedding custom fonts:
        1. Download required font using fontsquirrel.com
        2. By default they are downloaded in TTF format. So convert them to woff using Generator tab on fontsquirrel.com.
        3. Upload the fonts on Generator tab and click on 'Download your kit'.
        4. Move the downloaded files into VS Code and copy the code written in stylesheet present in downloaded folder.

        • Problem with custom fonts: flash of unstyled text
        - It means that when the browser will download our custom font, it will use a fallback font.
        - Hence, our text may appear unstyled.

        Cache: 
        - It is a kind of temporary storage that browser use to store the assets used in a website.
        - So that, whenever there is a need for that asset, the browser can quickly retrieve that from cache rather than fetching it from the original source(server).
        - For example: As we visit some web pages, the browser may download some images or font files in its cache.

        - Here, we disable cache so that the resources get downloaded everytime we refresh the page.
        - Now, if we set the throttling tab to 3G and refresh the page, we see arial for short period of time and then we see opensans.
        - This happens because due to slow network speed, download of font file takes a few seconds till that the browser shows arial or helvetica.
        - Then as the font file gets downloaded it displays the text in opensans.
        - This is called Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT).
        - Sometimes, due to fout we may experience some element shifting from there place due to different font. So, it provides a bad user experience.
        - But we cannot avoid this completely as to use the custom font, the font file has to be downloaded to users computer.
        - We can only minimize it.

        • Two ways to minimize it:
        1. font-display property
        2. Go to fontsquirrel.com and enable Expert setting.
            - Then select custom subsetting option and then select the characters which we want on our webpage.
            - As a result, some of the characters are not included in font file.
            - So, its size gets reduced.
