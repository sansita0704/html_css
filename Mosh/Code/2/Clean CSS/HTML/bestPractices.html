        â€¢ 8 Best Practices

        1. Following a naming convention.
            - Kebab Case: separate multiple words using a hyphen.
            e.g. - nav-bar
            - Camel Case: first letter of first word is small but first letter of every word that comes after is capital.
            e.g. - navBar
            - Pascal Case: first letter of every word is capital.
            e.g. - NavBar
            - Separate each word using an underscore.
            e.g. - nav_bar

        2. Create logical sections in the stylesheet.
            - For large projects, we separate our stylesheet into multiple sections and then combine them.
            - But for smaller projects, we separate one style sheet into some logical sections.
            - We can do this by adding comments for every type of style.

            e.g. - Basic Styles (for *, html and body)
            Typography (h1, h2, h3)
            Forms (For all the input fields)
            Navigation Bar

        3. Avoid over-specific selectors.
        4. Avoid !important keyword as much as possible.

        5. Sort CSS properties: Search Sort Lines Ascending in command pallete.

        6. Take advantage of style inheritance.
            - We can set font-family for nav-bar so that it is inherited by anchor and li elements.
            - Hence, we do not have to apply it separately for both the elements.

        7. Extract repetitive patterns from the stylesheet. (Object-Oriented CSS)

        8. Avoid repetitive values (Keep it DRY)
            - Use CSS variables or custom properties or global variables to keep the code dry.

        <div class="nav-bar">
            <a href="#" class="brand">My Website</a>
            <ul class="items">
                <li class="nav-item">Link 1</li>
                <li class="nav-item">Link 2</li>
                <li class="nav-item">Link 3</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <!--
        - To style these li elements we should not use a selctor like 'div.nav-bar > ul.items > li'
        - The specificity of this selector is 23.
        - As we add more and more over-specific selectors, it will be hard to maintain our code over time.

        - To reduce its specificity:

        1. Avoid using direct child selectors as much as possible because if in future, we wrap the ul element inside a div then our styles would break.
        div.nav-bar ul.items li

        2. We should not write the name of HTML element as if in future, we change the element to nav then our styles would break.
        .nav-bar .items li
        - For li element, we can give it a class of item so it doesn.t matter we write li or another type of element in the future.
        .nav-bar .items .item

        3. We don't need '.items'.
        - As soon as the element with the class of item is inside nav-bar our rule will work.
        .nav-bar .item

        4. Here, if we have a general rule for the elements with the class of item.
        - e.g. - We have a background color for item, then we have to undo that style for our item inside nav-bar.
        - To prevent this, we can use a more specific class for our item inside nav-bar like 'nav-item'
        .nav-bar .nav-item

        5. Now, we do not have to add nav-bar also because we will not use this class anywhere outside nav-bar.
        .nav-item

        - Now the specificity becomes 10.

        <div class="one"></div>
        <br />
        <div class="two"></div>
        <!--
        - We can use CSS variables to store values of some properies that we can reuse throughout our code.
        - We define them using ':root' pseudo-class selector.
        - It matches the html element.
        - We start by adding two hyphens and then give the custom property a name.
        - We can access them using var().

        - So all the properties get inherited by all the elements and are accessible using var function.
