        â€¢ BEM - Block Element Modifier
        - It is a popular naming convention.
        - Its idea is to think of our webpage as a bunch of blocks or components or modules.
        - These blocks can contain elements or other blocks. 
        - These blocks can be modified to create different version of the same block and then we can compose all of them to create complex web pages.
        - We use modifier to create different versions of our block.
        - Blocks can have header, footer or side-bar.

        - BEM Naming Convention:
        For element: .block-name__element-name
        For modifier: .block-name--modifier-name
        -->

        <div class="card card--popular ">
            <header class="card__header">
                <span class="card__price"></span>
            </header>
            <!--
            - We want to give this header a class so that we do not have to use element type selector in stylesheet.
            - But we do not want any generic name like header otherwise the styles applied to some other header on the webpage will leak into it.
            - So we prefix it with the block name.

            - For span, card__header__price would be too long so we only write card__price because the price is the part of card.
            -->

            <div class="card__body">
                <button class="btn"></button>
                <!--
                - Here, we do not give it a class like card__btn.
                - This is because button is a independent block which can exist outside of this block.
                - So, we do not add a prefix.
