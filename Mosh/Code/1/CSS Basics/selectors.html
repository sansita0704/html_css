        Selectors are used to select or target the HTML elements which we want to style.

        Types of selectors:
        
        1. Universal selector (*)
        2. Type selector (name of element)
        3. Class selector (.class_name)
        4. Id selector (#id)

        Note: While using class selector it is advisable to remove the type of element and only write class name for styling so that if in case we change the type of element to something else then also the code works correctly.

        <!--
        Class:
        - Short for classification 
        - It is used to separate different elements into different categories like the categories in a supermarket of grocery, clothing, etc.
        - The class names can be used to apply similar styles to multiple elements.
        - So, multiple elements can be given same class name.

        Id:
        - Short for identifier
        - Id attribute assigns a unique identifier to an HTML element.
        - It is used to apply styles to a particular element.
        - No two elements should have same id.
