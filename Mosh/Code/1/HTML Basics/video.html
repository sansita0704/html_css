    - 'controls' - It is a boolean attribute i.e. it can take only two values true or false 
    - In HTML, the absence of 'controls' attribute represents false and its presence represents true so there is no meaning of assigning some value to it 
    - 'autoplay' - video gets automatically played when the page is refreshed
