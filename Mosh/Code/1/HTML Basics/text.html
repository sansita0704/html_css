        'charset' attribute is used to define what character set has been used in this html file

        Computers can't understand the letters a,b,c or symbols so various character sets are used which assigns a unique code or numeric value to each character.

        e.g - ASCII character set - can represent all the letters of english language
        UTF-8 - can represent almost all the characters we use

        - 'em' tag is used when we have to emphasis some content 
        - By default, it does the text to italic but we can change it in style tag
        - It should not be used for styling because it is used to give emphasis content which helps search engines to extract important information about the webpage
        - All the styling part should be done with css inside style tag, HTML is used only for structuring the webpage
