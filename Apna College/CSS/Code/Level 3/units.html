        Parent element: The element which contains one or more elements within its opening and closing tags.
        Child element: The element which is contained between the opening and closing tags of parent element.
        Every element has a parent element except html which is a root element.

        Two types of units:

        1. Absolute units: These are fixed units and are not dependent on other elements.
        eg: px (pixels) - 10 px will be fixed for all elements

        2. Relative units: They are relative to a parameter like size of parent element.
        eg: % (percent) - relative to the size of parent element
            em - relative to the font-size of parent element or element itself
            rem (root em) - relative to the font-size of root element (<html>)  
            vh (viewport height)
            vw (viewport width)
